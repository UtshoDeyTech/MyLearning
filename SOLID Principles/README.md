## What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five fundamental principles of object-oriented programming and design, introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob). These principles help developers create software that is:

- **Maintainable** - Easy to modify and extend
- **Readable** - Clear and understandable code structure
- **Flexible** - Adaptable to changing requirements
- **Testable** - Simple to unit test and debug
- **Scalable** - Can grow with your application needs

The SOLID principles serve as a foundation for writing clean, robust code that stands the test of time.

## Why SOLID Matters

### Problems SOLID Solves:
- **Tight Coupling** - Components that are overly dependent on each other
- **Low Cohesion** - Classes that have multiple, unrelated responsibilities
- **Rigidity** - Code that is difficult to change without breaking existing functionality
- **Fragility** - Systems where small changes cause unexpected failures
- **Immobility** - Code that cannot be reused in different contexts

### Benefits of Following SOLID:
- ‚úÖ **Easier Maintenance** - Changes are isolated and predictable
- ‚úÖ **Better Testing** - Components can be tested in isolation
- ‚úÖ **Improved Collaboration** - Teams can work on different parts independently
- ‚úÖ **Reduced Bugs** - Well-structured code has fewer defects
- ‚úÖ **Faster Development** - Reusable components speed up development
- ‚úÖ **Lower Costs** - Less time spent on debugging and refactoring

## The Five Principles

### üéØ [S] Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**"A class should have only one reason to change."**

Every class should have a single, well-defined responsibility. When a class has multiple responsibilities, changes to one responsibility can affect the others, leading to fragile code.

```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Multiple responsibilities
class User:
    def save_to_database(self): pass
    def send_email(self): pass
    def validate_data(self): pass

# ‚úÖ Good: Single responsibility
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, email): pass

class UserRepository:
    def save(self, user): pass

class EmailService:
    def send_welcome_email(self, user): pass
```

**[üìñ Detailed Guide](Single_responsibility_principle.md)**

### üîì [O] Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**"Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification."**

You should be able to add new functionality without changing existing code. This is achieved through abstraction and polymorphism.

```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Must modify existing code for new shapes
class AreaCalculator:
    def calculate_area(self, shape):
        if shape.type == "rectangle":
            return shape.width * shape.height
        elif shape.type == "circle":
            return 3.14 * shape.radius ** 2
        # Adding triangle requires modifying this method

# ‚úÖ Good: Extensible without modification
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def calculate_area(self): pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def calculate_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2
```

**[üìñ Detailed Guide](Open_closed_principle.md)**

### üîÑ [L] Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**"Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program."**

Subclasses should be able to replace their parent classes without breaking the application's functionality.

```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Square violates LSP
class Rectangle:
    def set_width(self, width): self.width = width
    def set_height(self, height): self.height = height

class Square(Rectangle):
    def set_width(self, width): 
        self.width = self.height = width  # Unexpected behavior
    def set_height(self, height): 
        self.width = self.height = height  # Unexpected behavior

# ‚úÖ Good: Proper inheritance
class Shape(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def area(self): pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def area(self): return self.width * self.height

class Square(Shape):
    def area(self): return self.side ** 2
```

**[üìñ Detailed Guide](Liskov_substitution_principle.md)**

### üîß [I] Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**"Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use."**

Create specific interfaces for specific client needs rather than one general-purpose interface.

```python
# ‚ùå Bad: Fat interface
class MultiFunctionDevice(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def print(self): pass
    @abstractmethod
    def scan(self): pass
    @abstractmethod
    def fax(self): pass

class SimplePrinter(MultiFunctionDevice):
    def print(self): print("Printing...")
    def scan(self): raise NotImplementedError()  # Forced to implement
    def fax(self): raise NotImplementedError()   # Forced to implement

# ‚úÖ Good: Segregated interfaces
class Printer(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def print(self): pass

class Scanner(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def scan(self): pass

class SimplePrinter(Printer):
    def print(self): print("Printing...")

class AllInOne(Printer, Scanner):
    def print(self): print("Printing...")
    def scan(self): print("Scanning...")
```

**[üìñ Detailed Guide](Interface_segregation_principle.md)**

### ‚¨áÔ∏è [D] Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**"High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions."**

Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations to reduce coupling.

```python
# ‚ùå Bad: High-level depends on low-level
class EmailService:
    def send(self, message): pass

class NotificationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.email_service = EmailService()  # Tight coupling
    
    def notify(self, message):
        self.email_service.send(message)

# ‚úÖ Good: Both depend on abstraction
class NotificationService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def send(self, message): pass

class EmailService(NotificationService):
    def send(self, message): pass

class NotificationManager:
    def __init__(self, service: NotificationService):
        self.service = service  # Depends on abstraction
    
    def notify(self, message):
        self.service.send(message)
```

**[üìñ Detailed Guide](Dependency_inversion_principle.md)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with Python's `abc` module for abstract base classes

### Installation
No installation required! These are design principles, not a library. However, you might want to install typing extensions for better type hints:

```bash
pip install typing-extensions
```

### Quick Setup
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Protocol, List, Dict, Any

# You're ready to implement SOLID principles!
```

## Documentation

Each principle has detailed documentation with theory, examples, and best practices:

| Principle | Document | Key Concept |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Single Responsibility** | [SRP Guide](Single_responsibility_principle.md) | One class, one responsibility |
| **Open/Closed** | [OCP Guide](Open_closed_principle.md) | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| **Liskov Substitution** | [LSP Guide](Liskov_substitution_principle.md) | Subclasses must be substitutable |
| **Interface Segregation** | [ISP Guide](Interface_segregation_principle.md) | Many specific interfaces vs one general |
| **Dependency Inversion** | [DIP Guide](Dependency_inversion_principle.md) | Depend on abstractions, not concretions |

### What Each Guide Contains:
- üìö **Detailed Theory** - Deep dive into the principle
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Violations** - What not to do and why
- ‚úÖ **Correct Implementations** - Proper examples in Python
- üõ†Ô∏è **Refactoring Guides** - How to fix violations

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Checklists** - Validation guidelines

## Quick Reference

### When to Apply Each Principle

| Situation | Apply | Why |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Class doing multiple things | **SRP** | Separate concerns for maintainability |
| Adding new features breaks old code | **OCP** | Enable extension without modification |
| Subclass breaks parent's contract | **LSP** | Ensure proper inheritance |
| Interface has unused methods | **ISP** | Create focused interfaces |
| Hard-coded dependencies | **DIP** | Depend on abstractions |

### Code Smells to Watch For

- üö® **Large classes** with many methods (SRP violation)
- üö® **Long if-else chains** based on type (OCP violation)  
- üö® **Empty method implementations** or exceptions (LSP violation)
- üö® **Fat interfaces** with unrelated methods (ISP violation)
- üö® **Hard-coded class instantiation** (DIP violation)

### Benefits Summary

| Principle | Primary Benefit |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **SRP** | Easier to understand and modify |
| **OCP** | Add features without breaking existing code |
| **LSP** | Reliable polymorphism and inheritance |
| **ISP** | Reduced coupling and focused interfaces |
| **DIP** | Flexible, testable, and maintainable code |

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Small
Don't try to implement all principles at once. Start with SRP and gradually apply others.

### 2. Refactor Gradually
Apply SOLID principles during refactoring rather than trying to get everything perfect from the start.

### 3. Use Type Hints
Leverage Python's type system to make interfaces and dependencies clear.

### 4. Embrace Composition
Favor composition over inheritance to achieve better separation of concerns.

### 5. Test-Driven Development
SOLID principles make testing easier. Use TDD to guide your design.

### 6. Regular Code Reviews
Make SOLID compliance part of your code review process:

- ‚úÖ Does this class have a single responsibility?
- ‚úÖ Can we extend this without modification?
- ‚úÖ Are all subclasses truly substitutable?
- ‚úÖ Are interfaces focused and cohesive?
- ‚úÖ Do we depend on abstractions?

## Real-World Applications

SOLID principles are essential in various development scenarios:

### Web Development
- Controllers handling only HTTP concerns (SRP)
- Service layers managing business logic (SRP)
- Repository patterns for data access (DIP)
- Extensible middleware systems (OCP)

### Data Processing
- ETL pipelines extensible for new data types (OCP)
- Processors with single responsibilities (SRP)
- Pluggable data transformation systems (DIP)

### Microservices
- Service interfaces with specific responsibilities (ISP)
- Dependency injection for service communication (DIP)
- Extensible service discovery mechanisms (OCP)

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. God Classes
Classes that handle multiple unrelated responsibilities, making them difficult to maintain and test.

### 2. Anemic Domain Models
Classes with only data and no behavior, missing the benefits of object-oriented design.

### 3. Leaky Abstractions
Abstractions that expose implementation details, reducing flexibility and maintainability.
